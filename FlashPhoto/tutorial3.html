		<h1>Converting and Segmenting a CT Scan Using Mia</h1>
		<p>
			This is a tutorial that will walk through the steps necessary to process a series of CT scans using the MIA command line interface. <br>
			For this tutorial, we will assume that you are running Mia in a directory that has a folder called "brainstack/" that contains a series of CT scan images that are saved in the format mrbrain-8bit###.png, where ### are consecutive numbers from 001 to 099.<br><br>
			<div class = "images"> 
				<span class = "bolden"> Terminal with brainstack directory and format name
					<img class = "positioningOneMia" src = "maiexample.png" alt = "Mia command line">&nbsp;
				</span>
			</div>	
			<br>
			The MIA command line interface is a powerful tool. Here, we're going to be able to use it to perform a number of changes to our brainstack with one command. For this case, we're going to blur the images slightly (to reduce noise), 
			quantize the result into 4 bins, and save the images in a new directory. 
			This will give us quantized versions of the images that represent 4 different tissue types.
			<br>
			<br> 
			<div class = "images"> 
				<span class = "bolden"> Running of Mia command in command line/terminal
					<img class = "positioningOneMia" src = "miacommandline.png" alt = "Mia command line">&nbsp;
				</span>
			</div>	
			<br>
			Navigate to the terminal where Mia is located, and type "./Mia brainstack -blur 5 -quantize 4 brainstack_out", then press enter. The MIA app will create the directory brainstack_out, 
			apply the changes to the images, and store them there. The image processing algorithms are somewhat complex, so it will take a few moments. When the program is finished, you can open brainstack_out to inspect the results.

			<div class = "images"> 
				<span class = "bolden"> BrainStack_Out directory
					<img class = "positioningOneMia" src = "brainstackout.png" alt = "Brain stack out directory image">&nbsp;
				</span>

			For a more detailed rundown of the individual processing commands MIA supports, you can type "./Mia -h" in the terminal.
