		<h1>3081W FlashPhoto, Mia and libphoto</h1>
		<p>Welcome to the homepage for support for both users and developers for our <a class="link" href="http://www-users.cselabs.umn.edu/classes/Spring-2016/csci3081_afternoon/index.php?page=syllabus">CSCI 3081W</a> project: FlashPhoto, Mia, and libphoto.</p>
		<p>FlashPhoto is an image editing application which supports simple drawing and filters, as well as loading and saving images. Mia is a "medical imaging application" used for vieweing medical images such as MRIs or brain scans. 'libphoto' is the base of code we wrote to support all this.</p>

		<h2>Users </h2>
		<img src="stamp.png" alt ="stamp-demo" title = "It's a stamp!" id= "example-pic">

		<p> This page provides support for users, located <a class="link" href="usersupport.html">here</a>. It includes all information necessary to get up and running with both FlashPhoto and Mia.</p>

		<h2>Developers</h2>
		<p>Interested in using our code, either to expand upon our applications or to write your own? You're in luck. Support for developers can be found <a class="link" href="developersupport.html">here</a>. These pages contain several helpful resources. First is doxygen documentation to understand the APIs in the library we created.
		Second is a collection of "Design and Coding Style" resources, which include an overview of the project design, tutorials for adding new features, a style/documentation guide, as well as blog posts written by the developers
	 	to give some insight into the standard process behind developing our applications.</p>
