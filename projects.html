        <h1>Software Projects</h1>
        <p>This is a sample of some of the work I've completed over the course of my undergraduate career. It includes class projects as well as personal projects.</p>

        <h2>Procedural Story Generation Algorithm</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Semester-long-senior project completed in accordance with Latin honors requirements at the University of Minnesota.</li>
            <li>Extension of <a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~bilal/papers/AAMAS14_MCTS.pdf">previous work</a> completed by Bilal Kartal at the Univeristy of Minnesota. Uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to generate stories that conform to two different models of story structure: the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_structure'>“Freytag’s Pyramid”</a> model, and one inferred from stories written by survey respondents. Stories are also evaluated on 'believability' and how many user defined goals they accomplish</li>
            <li>Conducted under the supervision of <a href='http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~bilal/'>Bilal Kartal</a> and <a href='http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~sjguy/'>Dr. Stephen J. Guy</a> at the University of Minnesota.</li>

        <h2>"Plagiarized in Plain Sight": Unity Clone of <a href='http://store.steampowered.com/app/303590/'>Hidden in Plain Sight</a> with Improved Crowd AI</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Classroom group project that recreated Hidden in Plain Sight, a multiplayer game focused on blending into a crowd of AI agents.</li>
            <li>The original game used a simple random walk to control AI crowd. We extended this to model the crowd based on Dr. Stephen Guy’s <a href='http://motion.cs.umn.edu/PowerLaw/'>Time-To-Collision crowd simulation algorithm</a>, which is collision free, and produces more realistic movement.</li>
            <li>Game also features hand-made animations, controller support, and full sound.</li>
            <li>Group Members: Josh Ford, Thomas Hvizdos, Devin Lange, and Sam Vipond.</li>

        <h2>FlashPhoto: A Middle-Weight Image Editing Application</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Semester group-project for the UMN software design class.</li>
        <li>Pair of image editing applications:
            <ul>
                <li>FlashPhoto: A program similar to MSPaint, with additional features</li>
                <li>MIA: A "medical image editing" software with a command line interface</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Features include:
            <ul>
                <li>Several Tools: Pen, Spray Can, Calligraphy Pen, 'Grass' brush, etc.</li>
                <li>Filter Options:Blur, Motion-Blur, Threshold, Quantize, Pixelize, etc.</li>
                <li>Image save/load: JPG and PNG supported.</li>
                <li>Mia program features a command line interface for processing large numbers of images at once.</li>

        <h2>FIRETEAM: A Squad Level Tactical Turn-Based Shooter</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Written from the ground up in C++ and basic graphics library <a href='http://www.sfml-dev.org/'>SFML</a>. Levels created in <a href='http://www.mapeditor.org/'>Tiled</a> and stored as XML.
            <li>Turn based shooter featuring directional cover, hand-to-hand and ranged combat mechanics, resource management, and squad members with unique abilities and attributes.</li>
            <li>Visual-novel-style narrative, providing  story choices that impact game path, combat encounters, supplies, and other variables.</li>
            <li>GUI featuring context sensitive highlighting and hover-over text.</li>
            <li>Written over summer 2015, while also working 20-30 hours a week at a part time job</li>
            <li><a href='./FIRETEAM.zip' download>Download</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Note: </b>FIRETEAM is mechanically complete, and playable. However, time constraints prevented full implementation of the content I had originally planned for the game. The unfinished “demo” portion has 4 levels, more than 5500 lines of text, and 60+ pieces of art. A recent hard drive crash (and lack of backups) recently rendered the source code, writing, and art unrecoverable.</p>
        <p><b>Note 2: </b>I went into this project with no knowledge of C++, game design, or software design principles. While I’m proud of the results from a technical standpoint, the game was pretty evidently overambitious, and I’m not sure it’s very much fun to play if you’re not me. However, it was an extremely valuable practical lesson in the importance of playtesting, clean and modular design, and the amount of effort that goes into creating a finished product.</p>
