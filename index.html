        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>I'm a 22-year-old recent graduate of the UMN interested in broadening my experience in professional software development.</p>
        <p>This site is designed to highlight some of the personal and academic projects I'm most proud of, as well as provide contact information and a current resume. It is self-consciously barebones!</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I'm a fan of boardgames, hip hop music, and the outdoors. I spent my summer travelling in California, during which I worked on an organic farm and spent a month backpacking in the High Sierras.</p>
